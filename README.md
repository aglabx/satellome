Hypotesis to check:

Part A.

- large tandem repeats flanks contigs in centromere and telomere regions
- contig flanking is a good diagnostic feature for large tandem repeats searching

Tools to implement:

- tools that analazed genome dataset and search TR that flanks contigs
- and annotate that repeats
- and mark contigs that flank centromeric region

Part B.

- inside primates/carnivora/rodents/anumals exist taxon specific large tandem repeats
- inside primates/carnivora/rodents/anumals exist taxon-group specific large tandem repeats

Dataset to make:

- taxon to all large tandem repeats
- large tandem repeat to taxons
- large tandem repert to its annotation
